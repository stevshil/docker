# Test Example

This example creates a simple MySQL DB and a script to create the schema and populate some simple data.

There is then a PHP web front end that will simply read the table in the DB and print to screen.

Your task is to use the PHP code and the SQL code to build 2 containers and launch them in OpenShift as Docker containers.  You should make use of existing PHP and MySQL docker images.
